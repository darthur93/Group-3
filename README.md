Business and Data Understanding\
Explain your stakeholder audience here\
The stakeholders are Zillow. They are the most used online real estate site. The current model they use to evaluate the price of homes has a median error rate of 1.9%. However, this error rate increases to 2.3% in Washington. This results in 9.8% of houses being at or above a 10% error rate. This can equate to 10s of thousands of dollars on an individual scale and millions at a company level. We are creating a model to reduce the errors in the Washington area. Having a better model will encourage use of the site and increase revenue. \
